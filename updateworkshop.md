0. Bubble (physical) observation
1. Draw space 
    Draw light
    Draw time

2. See bubble VR (how it works?)
3. Question: have you ever been in love?
                    What differences did you notice/feel observing physical versus digital bubble?
                     Is there a concrete thought in your mind?

Thinking the Interior
{explain process}
-Re/search 
    -How bubbles work?
          (Surface tension/minimal surfaces + gravity + turbulence + light/waves)
Artist example:
Tomas Saraceno - sphere and network theory
explore idea: “Humans are beings that participate in spaces unknown to physics.”
                    -Demonstrate how an internal/external question can lead a process of learning/           			unlearning = the creation of a charged idea. 

-Try: *Find  an ongoing thought/question/recurrent interest
	*Open it up (inside and outside the sphere) observe, draw, question, try, compare (loop)
	Go deeper
	Find connections
	Draw the network
	What is that space? How does it look like? 

-Close the circle (compare)
