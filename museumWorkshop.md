After reading Hans Haacke’s “Managers of Consciousness” I found myself wondering about the role of museums as institutions and participants of a "consciousness industry." Haacke's controversial ideas on "disinterested pleasure," "controlled ambiguity" and "social lubricant" made me consider it would be interesting to pay a visit to The Rubin Museum and it’s current thematic series: BRAINWAVE 2017(PERCEPTION) which calls to “change our brains, unshackle ourselves from the past, and unleash creativity, growth, and inspiration.”
